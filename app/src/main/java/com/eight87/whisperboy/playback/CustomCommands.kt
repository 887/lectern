/**
 * Phase N.5 — custom session commands surfaced to Android Auto as action buttons
 * + accepted from any controller (the phone-side player surface too, eventually).
 *
 * The strings are stable identifiers in the session-command namespace; Auto's UI
 * picks them up via [androidx.media3.session.SessionCommand] registration in
 * [WhisperboyLibrarySessionCallback.onConnect]. Bundle keys live alongside so
 * the parse / dispatch sides agree on the payload shape.
 *
 * Real handler implementations gate on Phase G (sleep timer) + Phase J (skip
 * silence / gain) landing — for now the callback registers + accepts the
 * commands and either dispatches to the wired backend (timer + speed are wired
 * today) or returns success with a logged no-op so the car UI doesn't show an
 * error toast (Phase J wires the rest).
