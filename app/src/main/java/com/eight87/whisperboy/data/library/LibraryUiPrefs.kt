/**
 * Library-screen UI preferences — render mode, sort key, filter chip.
 *
 * These three enums live in `data/library/` (not `ui/library/`) so the [LibraryUiSettings]
 * facet in this package can reference them without inverting the dependency direction
 * (data must not depend on UI). The pure-Kotlin sort/filter functions that consume them
 * still live alongside the composables in `ui/library/LibrarySorting.kt` — they're
 * pure-Kotlin and either layer works, but co-locating them with the screen keeps the
 * UI code path readable.
